                <p>
                    I'm a Head of Technology Solutions with a distinctly horizontal career (one that bridges technology, business, and the art of team leadership). My journey has been all about bringing ideas to life: from creative concepts for clients, through designing robust technical architectures, to delivering complete solutions and nurturing talented developers.
                </p>

                <h2>What I do:</h2>
                <p>
                    - I design scalable software and infrastructure architectures, finding innovative answers to my clients' unique challenges.<br />
                    - I develop comprehensive proposals, blending technical expertise with business insight to deliver true value.<br />
                    - I lead and empower tech teams, fostering growth, collaboration, and an agile approach to every project.<br />
                    - I connect with clients both technically and commercially, turning business needs into tangible, reliable solutions.
                </p>

                <h2>My approach:</h2>
                <p>
                    I thrive on solving complex problems with creativity and strategic pragmatism. I believe leadership flourishes when ideas from different worlds collide; learning never stops, and authentic digital experiences make the real difference.
                </p>

                <h2>Values and Passions:</h2>
                <p>
                    I love clean code, intuitive design, and resilient architectures. I aim to turn complexity into simple, actionable results, always with a focus on what works. Beyond work, I'm drawn to family, emerging technologies, and the continuous pursuit of new skills.
                </p>

                <h2>Why work with me?</h2>
                <p>
                    If you're looking for someone who can truly understand your digital goalsâ€”not just on a technical level, but strategically and relationally, I'm here (in Oltrematica) to bring vision, clarity, and innovation to your projects.
