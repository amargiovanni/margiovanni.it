It's 2 AM. Tomorrow is the big day: the official launch of the product you've been working on for months. You're nervous, excited, terrified. And then it hits you: "Did we configure monitoring? And when does the SSL certificate expire? Did we test the payment flow in production?"

That last-minute panic feeling - I've experienced it too many times. And each time I swore: "Never again, next time I'll be prepared."

After dozens of launches - some went great, others... less so - I learned that successful launches aren't luck. They're methodical preparation. They're a checklist that covers everything from code to marketing to customer success.

This is that checklist. Born from mistakes made, lessons learned, avoidable sleepless nights. It's not exhaustive for every case, but it covers what matters in most launches.

## The checklist checklist

Before launch, verify:
- [ ] Someone (preferably not who did the work) has checked each item
- [ ] Non-applicable items explicitly marked as N/A
- [ ] No critical items skipped "for quick launch"
- [ ] Team aligned on what constitutes success
- [ ] Celebration plan (important!)

## When do I actually launch?

This is the million-dollar question.

**Red flags to NOT launch:**

- Critical bugs affecting core functionality
- Known security vulnerabilities
- Payment system not working
- Data loss risk
- Team not ready (vacations, understaffed)

**Green lights:**

- Core value proposition works
- User can complete key journey end-to-end
- Non-critical issues are identified and triaged
- Team is ready and excited
- Monitoring is in place

**Remember:** Perfect is the enemy of good. You'll never launch if you wait for perfection. But don't launch broken.

## The human factor

Lists and checklists are useful. But launches are also emotional.

**Pre-launch nerves**

Normal. Breathe. You've done the work. You have the checklist. Trust the process.

**Team morale**

This is stressful for everyone. Check in with team. Celebrate small wins leading up. Pizza/coffee/snacks help.

**Post-launch crash**

After the adrenaline of launch, an emotional crash can come. Normal. Take time to recover. The work continues but at a sustainable pace.

**Celebrate**

Win or learn, you've launched something into the world. Very few people do this. Celebrate this achievement with the team.

## A final note

I've launched products that had tremendous success. And products that nobody used.

The checklist doesn't guarantee success. But it guarantees that failures, if they come, aren't from stupid and preventable things.

It guarantees you've done the work, that you're prepared, that you've given the product the best possible chance.

The rest - product-market fit, timing, a bit of luck - is out of your control.

But this checklist? That you can control.

So print this (or make your own version), check off each item, and when you're ready...

Launch.

The world is waiting for what you've built.
