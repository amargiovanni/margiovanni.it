The first time they put me in charge of a team, I thought I knew what to do. I was a good developer, I had technical experience, I knew best practices. How hard could it be?

Very hard, it turned out. Because managing people is completely different from writing code. Code does what you tell it (when there are no bugs). People don't. People have emotions, ambitions, fears, bad days. And especially, people aren't interchangeable resources.

That first experience was humbling. I made mistakes. Many. Some of which still make me cringe when I think about them. But I learned. And I continue to learn, because team management is a skill you never finish refining.

## The mindset shift

The first thing I had to learn: moving from individual contributor to manager requires a radical mindset change.

**From "I do things" to "I enable others to do things"**

My value is no longer in the code I write, but in the code the team produces. My success is measured by the team's success.

At first I felt useless. I saw my colleagues write code and I was in meetings, or solving blockers, or doing code reviews. "I'm not doing anything concrete," I thought.

But then I understood: when I remove a blocker for a developer, I enable them to be productive. When I do a good code review, I raise the quality of the whole team's code. When I create an environment where people feel safe and supported, the team produces its best work.

This is doing. It's just different from writing code.

**From technical expert to coach**

I'm no longer the one who solves all technical problems. I'm the one who helps others develop the capabilities to solve them.

Sometimes I see a junior struggling with a problem I could solve in five minutes. The temptation is strong: "Let me see, I'll fix it." But if I do, the junior doesn't learn. And next time they'll have the same problem.

Better: "Have you tried X? What do you think of Y? Show me how you've debugged so far." Guide, don't solve. It's slower, but builds long-term capabilities.

**From individual focus to system focus**

Before I worried about my task, my code, my performance. Now I have to think about the system: how the team collaborates, where there are bottlenecks, who needs support, how to balance workload.

It's like going from playing an instrument to conducting an orchestra. Completely different skills.

## Building the right team

A successful team starts with the right people. And "right" doesn't just mean "technically competent."

### Hiring: beyond technical skills

When I interview candidates, I obviously evaluate technical competence. But I also look at:

**Communication ability**

Can they explain complex concepts clearly? Do they listen to questions or just respond with what they want to say? In the team, we'll spend hours discussing architecture, debugging problems, reviewing code. Communication is crucial.

**Learning attitude**

Technology changes continuously. The specific skill they have today might be irrelevant in three years. But the attitude to learn lasts forever.

I ask them: "Tell me about a technology you learned recently. How did you do it?" The answers tell me a lot about how they approach learning.

**Humility and openness to feedback**

Brilliant but arrogant developers destroy teams. They create conflicts, don't accept feedback, discourage others.

I look for people who admit when they don't know something, who ask for help, who see code review as a growth opportunity, not a personal attack.

**Cultural fit**

Do they share the team's values? If the team values code quality and this person always cuts corners, there will be conflicts. If the team collaborates intensively and this person is a lone wolf, it will be difficult to integrate them.

I'm not talking about "everyone the same." Diversity of thought is valuable. But shared fundamental values are essential.

**Diversity of background**

Homogeneous teams all think the same way, have the same blind spots. Diverse teams - in background, experience, perspective - are more creative, more robust, see problems from different angles.

I actively seek diversity. It's the right thing to do ethically, and it leads to better teams.

### Onboarding that works

Ok, you hired the right person. Now you need to integrate them into the team. Good onboarding makes the difference between a new member who becomes productive in weeks and one who's still lost after months.

**Buddy system**

I assign a "buddy" - a team member who becomes the new person's main reference. For questions, for understanding team dynamics, for pair programming.

This takes pressure off the manager (me) and creates a bond between the new person and the team.

**Accessible documentation**

Clear README, architecture documentation, guides for environment setup. The new person must be able to start understanding the system without having to ask everything.

And if something isn't documented and the new person asks, it's an opportunity: "Great question. Want to document it so we help the next person?"

**Gradual tasks**

I don't throw the new person into the deep end. I start with small, well-defined, non-critical tasks. This allows them to familiarize themselves with the codebase and processes without excessive pressure.

As they gain confidence, tasks become more complex.

**Frequent check-ins**

In the first months, I talk with the new member often. "How's it going? Where are you blocked? What do you need?" I don't wait for them to ask for help - often new people don't want to seem incompetent.

## Communication: the team's glue

I've seen technically brilliant teams fail due to lack of communication. And mediocre teams technically have success because they communicated very well.

### Meetings that work

Meetings have a bad reputation. "Could have been an email." And often it's true - many meetings are waste of time.

But some meetings are essential. The key is making them effective.

**Daily standup**

Brief (15 minutes max). Everyone says: what I did yesterday, what I'm doing today, where I'm blocked. It's not a status report for the manager - it's for the team, to coordinate.

And important: blockers must be resolved immediately after standup, not ignored.

**Sprint planning**

We decide together what to do in the sprint. Not me assigning tasks, but the team self-organizing.

We estimate complexity together. We discuss approaches. Everyone has a voice. This creates ownership and commitment.

**Retrospectives**

Every sprint, we stop to reflect: what went well, what can improve, what we'll try differently.

This is crucial. Without retrospectives, the same problems repeat infinitely. With honest retrospectives, the team continuously improves.

**One-on-ones**

Every week or every two weeks, I talk individually with each team member. Not about tasks or projects - we do that elsewhere. But about them: how they are, are they happy, where they want to grow, what frustrates them.

These are the moments when you discover things that would never emerge in a group. And they're opportunities for coaching, for support, for building trust.

### Asynchronous communication

Not everything requires meetings. In fact, most communication should be asynchronous.

**Documentation**

Decision log, architecture documentation, how-to guides. Written, accessible, updated.

This answers common questions without having to ask every time.

**Pull requests as communication**

PRs aren't just for approving code. They're opportunities to share knowledge, discuss approaches, teach and learn.

I encourage detailed code reviews, questions, suggestions. And crucially: constructive feedback, never personal attacks.

**Slack/Teams with discipline**

Chat is useful for quick communication. But it can become a distracting mess.

I use specific channels for specific topics. I encourage threads instead of scattered messages. And I establish there's no expectation of immediate response - if it's urgent, I call or have a meeting.

### Creating psychological safety

Communication is effective only if people feel safe to speak.

**Admitting your own mistakes**

As a leader, I must be the first to say "I was wrong" or "I don't know." This normalizes imperfection and encourages others to be honest.

**No blame culture**

When something goes wrong, we don't look for culprits. We look for systemic causes and how to prevent the problem in the future.

"Who made this bug?" is the wrong question. "How can we fix the process so these bugs get caught earlier?" is the right question.

**Valuing different opinions**

When someone proposes an idea that goes against consensus, I listen seriously instead of dismissing it. Sometimes that idea is brilliant. Other times not, but the discussion it generates is still valuable.

## Managing performance

Not everyone on the team performs at the same level, always. And this needs to be managed.

### Recognizing and celebrating good work

People need to know when they do well. Not just at the annual performance review, but daily.

A "great job on that PR" in public. A private message to thank them for helping a colleague. Mentioning their contributions in meetings with stakeholders.

This costs nothing and has enormous impact on morale and motivation.

### Addressing under-performance

When someone isn't performing, ignoring it doesn't help. It gets worse, creates resentment in the rest of the team, and isn't fair to the person themselves.

**First, understand why**

Under-performance is rarely just "lazy" or "incompetent." There are causes:
- Lack of clarity on expectations
- Skill gap that can be filled with training
- Personal problems outside work
- Mismatch between their skills and assigned tasks
- Burnout

Talk openly with the person. "I noticed that [specific what]. Has something happened? How can I help?"

**Create an improvement plan**

If the problem is fixable, we create a plan together. Clear goals, necessary support, reasonable timeline.

And regular follow-up. Not "let's see in six months if it improved." Weekly check-ins to see progress and adjust the plan.

**When it doesn't improve**

Sometimes, despite efforts, the person doesn't improve. At that point, continuing to keep them on the team isn't fair - neither for the team that suffers from it, nor for the person who's in the wrong role for them.

Letting someone go is emotionally difficult. But when done with respect and clarity, it's the right decision.

## Balancing workload and preventing burnout

Burnout is real and destructive. And as a manager, it's my responsibility to prevent it.

### Recognizing the signals

Drop in code quality. Unusual irritability. Increased absences. Disengagement. These are warning signs.

And I must watch myself too. Managers often burn out because they don't set boundaries.

### Distributing work fairly

Not all tasks are equal. Some are interesting and growth-oriented. Others are boring but necessary.

I distribute so everyone has a mix of both. Not always the coolest tasks to seniors and boring maintenance to juniors.

And watch out for the "reliable person trap": that person who always does great work ends up receiving more and more work, until they burn out.

### Saying no

When stakeholders always ask for more, I must protect the team.

"We can do it, but it means X will slip" or "We can't with current resources. What do we de-prioritize?"

Saying no is part of the job. Especially when the team is already at the limit.

### Encouraging time off

People must take vacation. And when they're on vacation, they must completely disconnect.

If I send messages to someone on vacation, I'm implicitly saying it's not ok to disconnect. So I don't do it.

And I model the behavior: I take my vacation, I disconnect, I come back rested.

## Managing conflicts

When you put together intelligent people with strong opinions, there will be conflicts. This is normal. The problem is when conflicts aren't managed and become toxic.

### Technical conflicts

"Should we use X or Y?" Different opinions are healthy. They lead to better solutions.

My role: facilitate discussion, ensure it's based on data and reasoning, not ego. And when needed, make the final decision.

But make clear: once decided, everyone aligns. No continuous sabotage from whoever wanted the other option.

### Personal conflicts

More difficult. Two people who simply can't stand each other.

I must intervene early. One-on-ones with both to understand perspectives. Then together, to find a way to work professionally even if they're not friends.

If the conflict impacts the team, I can't ignore it. And if it doesn't resolve, one of them might have to leave.

### My conflict with a team member

Sometimes the conflict is with me. The person doesn't agree with my decision, or how I manage something.

This is ok. In fact, if no one ever disagrees with me, I'm probably creating an environment where people are afraid to speak.

I listen seriously. Sometimes I'm wrong and I modify. Other times I explain the reasoning better. The important thing is that the person feels heard.

## Growth and team development

People want to grow. And as a manager, it's my responsibility to facilitate it.

### Clear career paths

What's needed to go from junior to mid? From mid to senior? The criteria must be clear, not mysterious.

And there isn't just the "manager" path. There's also senior individual contributor, technical lead, architect. Career must be possible without having to manage people.

### Learning opportunities

Conferences, courses, books, time for side projects. I invest in team training.

Sometimes it means budget. Other times it means just allowing them to dedicate 10% of time to exploring new technologies.

### Mentorship

Senior mentoring junior. Everyone learns something - the junior technical skills, the senior teaching and leadership skills.

And I myself try to be a mentor. Pair programming, detailed code reviews, discussions on architectural decisions.

### Stretch assignments

Giving people opportunities just outside their comfort zone. Not so much as to set up for failure, but enough to make them grow.

The junior who leads a small feature. The mid who presents to stakeholders. The senior who designs a new system.

This is where real growth happens.

## The mistakes I made (and try not to repeat)

Let me share some mistakes, so maybe you avoid them.

### Micromanagement

At first, I wanted to know everything. Every implementation detail. Every decision went through me.

Result: frustrated team that felt not-trusted. And I was a bottleneck for everything.

I learned: assume competence. Give context and goals, not prescriptions on how to do it. Trust and verify, don't control every step.

### Not giving difficult feedback

I avoided difficult conversations. "He's a good guy, he'll improve on his own." Spoiler: he didn't improve.

By letting problems fester, I did damage to the person (who didn't know what to fix) and to the team (who had to compensate).

I learned: feedback is a gift. Difficult to give, but necessary. Early and often.

### Treating everyone equally

"Fair means everyone equal," I thought. But people have different needs. One needs autonomy, one needs close guidance. One wants to work from home always, one prefers office.

I learned: fair isn't equal. Fair is giving each person what they need to do their best work.

### Always saving

When someone struggled, I intervened to solve. Thinking I was helping.

But I was creating dependency. People didn't develop problem-solving capabilities because they knew I would solve it.

I learned: offer support, not solutions. "How do you think you'll approach it? Do you need resources? Want to discuss it together?" But let them solve.

### Not celebrating victories

Too much focus on problems, little on successes. Finished a feature? Ok, next.

The team felt work was never recognized. Low morale.

I learned: take time to celebrate. A launched feature is a victory. A difficult bug fix is a victory. Recognize it.

### Ignoring my health

I worked too much. Nights, weekends. "I must be an example." But the example I gave was of unsustainable workaholic.

And I burned out.

I learned: I must take care of myself to be able to take care of the team. Boundaries, time off, health first.

## The rewards

Managing a team is difficult. Emotionally draining. Full of difficult decisions.

But it's also incredibly rewarding.

Seeing someone who enters as junior and after two years is mid, competent and confident. Seeing the team that works like a well-oiled machine, where everyone knows their role and supports each other. Launching a product the team built together, with shared pride.

That moment when a team member comes to you and says "Thank you, I learned so much working with you." That's worth all the difficulties.

Because in the end, managing a team isn't managing resources. It's enabling people. It's creating an environment where they can do their best work. It's seeing them grow and knowing you contributed.

And that's deeply human and deeply meaningful.

Every day is a new challenge. Every team is different. Every person is unique.

But the principles remain: respect, clarity, support, growth, celebration, accountability.

With these, you build teams that not only produce excellent work, but where people want to stay, want to give their best, and grow together.

And there's no technology, framework or tool that can replace this.
