My aunt is 73 years old. Last year she needed to renew her ID card. She called me in a panic: "They tell me I have to do it online but I don't understand how." I guided her on the phone for half an hour, through an interface that was technically functional but humanly incomprehensible.

In the end we made it. But afterward I thought: how many people like my aunt find themselves in front of these systems without anyone to help them? How many give up? How many go physically to the office, waiting in line for hours, because digital is too complicated?

This is the reality of digital transformation in public services. It's not just about technology. It's about people, inclusion, rights. Because accessing public services isn't optional - it's necessity, sometimes urgent.

And when digital excludes instead of including, we have failed.

## Why digital transformation in public services is different

I've worked both in private and public. And the difference is profound.

**In private, the user can choose**

If your app sucks, the person goes to the competitor. The market punishes bad user experience. You have natural incentive to do well.

**In public, often there's no alternative**

You must pay taxes. You must renew documents. You must interface with offices for permits, subsidies, health services. You can't say "I'll go to the other State." You're forced to use the system, good or bad.

This changes everything. The responsibility is immense. You're not building a product, you're building civic infrastructure. And every person excluded is a person you've denied a right.

**Very different users**

In private you can target. "Our product is for tech-savvy millennials." In public you must serve everyone: young and old, tech-literate and not, with disabilities, with different languages, with poor or absent internet connections.

You must design for the lowest common denominator while maintaining efficiency for those more capable. This is enormous design challenge.

**Bureaucratic constraints and legacy**

Complex legacy systems, often decades-old. Rigid regulations. Long procurement processes. Politics interfering. Limited and uncertain budgets.

In private, if you need to change something, you change. In public, every change goes through layers of approvals, compliance, institutional resistance.

## Common mistakes (I've seen too often)

### Digitization without transformation

Most common: taking existing bureaucratic processes and putting them online without rethinking anything.

The paper form had 50 fields? The online form has 50 fields. It required three signatures? Online requires three uploads of signed documents.

Result: same complexity, now digitized. You haven't improved anything, you've just moved frustration from paper to screen.

**Real digital transformation** means rethinking the process from scratch. What information is really needed? What can we retrieve from existing databases instead of asking the user? How can we simplify the flow?

### Assuming technical competence

"Users can register with SPID." Sure, if they know what SPID is, how to get it, how to use it. My aunt didn't know.

Systems built assuming everyone has:
- Smartphone or computer
- Stable internet connection
- Email
- Ability to navigate complex interfaces
- Basic digital literacy

But millions of people don't have these things. And they have the same right to access services.

### Security theater that sacrifices usability

Security is important. But I've seen systems where:
- Password must have 16 characters with specific symbols
- Expires every month
- You can't reuse last 12 passwords
- Lockout after two failed attempts
- Requires two-factor authentication with SMS (which don't always arrive)

Result: people can't access. They call support. Support spends time resetting passwords. Enormous cost, frustrated users.

Security is balance. Must protect but not prevent legitimate access.

### One-size-fits-all

One digital channel only. But not everyone can use it the same way.

Multi-channel approach needed:
- Online for those who can and want
- Phone for those who prefer voice
- Physical for those who can't do digital
- Support to guide those with difficulties

And these channels must be integrated, not silos.

### Launch and forget

System gets built, launched with great fanfare. Then... no one maintains it. No one monitors problems. No one collects feedback. No one iterates.

After two years, the system is broken, outdated, full of unfixed bugs. But it's still the official system, so people are forced to use it.

In private, such a product would be abandoned. In public, it remains zombie indefinitely.

## How to do it right: principles that work

I've also seen successes. Public systems that really work, that people use willingly, that improve lives. It's not impossible. Requires right approach.

### User-centered from scratch

Before writing a line of code, talk with people who will use the system.

**Field research**

Go to offices. Observe how people currently interact with the service. Where do they get confused? What do they ask? What workarounds have they developed?

Talk with employees who do front-office. They see daily where the system fails. They're precious source of insights.

Talk with different citizens: young, old, with disabilities, immigrants, people in rural areas with poor connectivity.

**Co-design**

Involve users in design. Not "we made the system, tell us if you like it" but "how should it work according to you?"

Workshops, prototyping sessions, iterative tests. The system that emerges is better because informed by those who'll use it.

### Radical simplicity

Every form field, every process step, every document required - must justify its existence.

"We've always asked for it" isn't justification. "It's required by law" - verify if it's really required or rigid interpretation.

**Intelligent defaults**

Pre-fill everything you can. If you already have user's data in some database, use it. Don't make them re-type information already known.

**Progressive disclosure**

Don't show everything at once. Show first what's necessary, then any advanced options.

**Human language**

No bureaucratese. Write like you speak. If a twelve-year-old doesn't understand, rewrite.

"The undersigned requests issuance of registry certification" â†’ "I want to request a certificate"

### Accessibility not as afterthought

WCAG guidelines aren't optional. They're minimum.

**Screen reader compatible**

Test with screen readers. If a blind user can't use the system, you've excluded millions of people.

**Keyboard navigation**

Not everyone uses mouse. Everything must be accessible via keyboard.

**Contrast and typography**

Text readable even for those with vision problems. Adequate contrast ratios. Reasonable font sizes.

**Simple language**

Also helps people with cognitive difficulties, non-native speakers, anyone stressed or in a hurry.

**Mobile-first**

More and more people access only via smartphone. If it works only on desktop, you exclude many, especially economically disadvantaged groups.

### Robust support

Even the simplest system will have people who need help.

**Multiple channels**

Email, phone, chat, physical. Different people prefer different channels.

**Well-trained support**

Not outsourcing to call center with rigid scripts. People who understand the system, with authority to solve problems.

**FAQ and documentation**

Common questions already answered. Video tutorials. Step-by-step guides with screenshots.

**Feedback loop**

When many people ask same question, it's signal the system is confusing. Feedback becomes input for improvements.

### Continuous iteration

Launch is beginning, not end.

**Monitoring**

Analytics: where do people abandon? Where do they spend too much time? Error rates for every step.

Session recordings (anonymized): watch how real people use the system.

**Active feedback**

"How was your experience?" after every interaction. Simple rating + optional text field.

**Improvement cycles**

Every quarter, review data. Identify top 3 problems. Fix. Relaunch. Repeat.

This requires dedicated budget and team. Not "build and go to next project" but continuous ownership.

## Case studies: what works

### Estonia: digital government done right

Estonia is often cited as example. And for good reason.

**Universal digital identity**

Every citizen has digital ID. Not optional complex like SPID in Italy, it's default, easy, used by 99% of population.

**Interoperability**

Government databases talk to each other. When you make request, system automatically retrieves data from other databases. You don't have to bring documents, don't have to re-type.

**Once-only principle**

Give information to state once. Then state uses it where needed, without asking again.

**Trust and transparency**

You can see who accessed your data and why. This builds trust in system.

Not perfect. But demonstrates it's possible.

### UK Government Digital Service (GDS)

Transformed gov.uk from chaotic collection of sites to coherent and usable experience.

**Clear design principles**

"Start with user needs"
"Do less"
"Design with data"
"This is for everyone"

These principles guide every decision.

**Shared design patterns**

Reusable components. Every agency doesn't reinvent wheel. Consistency across government.

**Continuous improvement**

Permanent teams for iteration, not projects with end.

### Italy: small steps forward

In Italy we've struggled. But there are successes.

**PagoPA**

Standardized payments toward PA. No more "every municipality has its own system." One platform, same methods.

Not perfect, but enormous improvement from before.

**IO App**

Aggregating services from different PAs in one app. Notifications, payments, documents. Still early, but direction is right.

**Growing SPID adoption**

After slow start, adoption is growing. More services using it, more useful it becomes, more people adopt it. Positive network effects.

## The challenges that remain

I don't want to paint too optimistic picture. There are real challenges, difficult to solve.

### Legacy systems and technical debt

Systems built decades ago, in COBOL or obsolete languages. Scarce or nonexistent documentation. The only ones who understand them are close to retirement.

You can't simply throw away and start over. Too much risk, too much cost. But integrating with new is nightmare.

**Pragmatic approach:**
- Strangler fig pattern: build new around old, gradually replace
- API layers: wrap legacy with modern APIs
- Document while working: every time you touch legacy, document

It's slow, unglamorous work. But necessary.

### Procurement and contracting

Procurement processes are designed to minimize risk and corruption. Result: they're very slow and favor large vendors who can navigate bureaucracy.

Innovative startups with better solutions don't have patience or resources to compete.

And fixed-price contracts with detailed specs upfront are antithesis of agile development.

**What would help:**
- Smaller, more frequent procurements
- Evaluate track record of delivery, not just price
- Contracts that allow iteration

But changing this requires legislative reform, not just will.

### Resistance to change

Public organizations are risk-averse. New means unknown, unknown means potential risk.

"We've always done it this way" is powerful force.

And public employees who worked in certain way for decades see digitalization as threat: "Will we be obsolete?"

**Change management is crucial:**
- Involve early, explain why
- Adequate training
- Show digital makes their work easier, doesn't replace them
- Celebrate successes, build momentum

It's culture change work as much as technology.

### Digital divide

Not everyone has equal access to technology.

Elderly, poor, rural areas, people with disabilities - are often excluded.

Digital-first can't mean digital-only.

**Multi-channel is necessary:**
- Maintain non-digital options
- Invest in digital literacy programs
- Ensure connectivity even in remote areas
- Subsidies for devices for those who can't afford them

This costs. But it's cost of inclusion, and it's non-negotiable.

## The human impact when done well

When digital transformation works, impact is profound.

**Time saved**

Hours people don't spend in lines. Days they don't lose waiting for documents. This is time they can use for work, family, life.

For someone privileged, one hour saved is convenience. For someone who works hourly and can't afford day off, it's difference between paying rent or not.

**Reduced stress**

Interactions with bureaucracy are often stressful. If you make process simple, you remove that stress.

People already dealing with difficulties (health issues, job loss, emigration) shouldn't have additional burden of complex system.

**Empowerment**

When you can do things autonomously, when you have control and visibility over your relationship with institutions, you feel empowered citizen, not supplicant.

**Trust in institutions**

When public services work well, builds trust in institutions. And trust is foundation of democracy.

**Efficiency for PA**

Less load on front-office. Fewer errors. Faster processes. Freed resources can go to better services.

It's win-win when done well.

## The role of us technologists

If you work in tech, you can contribute to public digital transformation.

**Work directly for PA**

It's challenging, sometimes frustrating. But also deeply meaningful. You're literally improving lives of millions of people.

**Civic tech projects**

Open source projects that help government. Tools, platforms, libraries.

**Advocacy**

Use your voice to push for better digital services. Constructive feedback when you encounter problems.

**Skills sharing**

Public organizations often lack digital expertise. Workshops, mentorship, advisory.

Not everyone can (or wants to) work in public full-time. But everyone can contribute something.

## The future I want to see

Imagine a PA where:
- Accessing services is as simple as ordering on Amazon
- But with accessibility and inclusion Amazon doesn't need to have
- Data is yours, you control who sees it
- Processes are transparent, you understand what happens
- Feedback is listened to, systems continuously improve
- No one is left behind

This isn't utopia. It's achievable. Requires:
- Political will
- Adequate investment
- Right talent
- User-centered approach
- Long-term commitment

Some countries are already close. Others, including mine, have road to go.

But every small improvement counts. Every simplified form. Every speeded-up process. Every person who succeeds in doing digitally something that before required hours of queue.

This is work worth doing.

Because in the end, digital public services aren't about technology.

They're about people. People who need to renew documents, access healthcare, receive benefits, participate in democratic process.

And every time we make these things easier, more accessible, more inclusive, we're building better society.

This is the real transformation. Not digital for digital's sake. But digital in service of the human.

And this is purpose I can support with all of myself.
