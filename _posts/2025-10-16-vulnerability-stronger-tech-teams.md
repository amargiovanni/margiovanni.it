I was leading a critical project migration when I realized, three weeks in, that my architectural decision was wrong. Not just suboptimal. Wrong. We'd have to throw away weeks of work and start over.

I spent a weekend agonizing over how to tell the team. My brain kept offering escape routes: maybe I could find a way to salvage it, maybe I could frame it differently, maybe I could wait a bit longer to be absolutely sure. But Monday morning I walked into our standup and said it plainly: "I made a mistake. The architecture I chose won't work. We need to start over, and that's on me."

The silence that followed felt eternal. Then one of the senior engineers said, "Actually, I was worried about that too but I thought you knew something I didn't." Another chimed in, "Same. I had concerns but figured you'd already considered them."

That moment taught me something I've carried through every leadership role since: the instinct to appear infallible doesn't protect your authority. It suffocates your team.

## The myth we tell ourselves about tech leadership

There's this image of the tech leader that gets reinforced constantly. The visionary who sees three moves ahead. The architect who designs flawless systems. The manager who always has the right answer. The person who, when everyone else is panicking, remains calm and in control because they've already figured it out.

I've met leaders who work very hard to project this image. And I understand why. Tech leadership is often a performance, particularly in organizations where technical credibility equals authority. If you don't know something, if you make a mistake, if you show uncertainty, maybe people will question whether you should be in that role at all.

But here's what I've learned after years of both trying to be that person and working with people who succeeded at it: that kind of leadership creates fragile teams.

When the leader must always be right, what happens to the person who spots a problem? They second-guess themselves. "Maybe I'm wrong. They probably already thought of this." So they stay quiet. The problem grows. By the time it's undeniable, it's also much more expensive to fix.

When the leader must always have the answer, what happens to creative problem-solving? The team waits. They implement what you tell them to implement. They stop bringing ideas because the leader already knows what to do. Innovation dies not from lack of talent but from lack of permission.

When the leader must always be in control, what happens during genuine crises? People panic. Because they've never seen you not know what to do, they assume that when you're uncertain, everything is falling apart. Your facade of control has made them dependent rather than resilient.

The invincible leader myth doesn't make teams stronger. It makes them brittle.

## What vulnerability actually means

I need to be clear about what I mean by vulnerability in leadership because the word gets misunderstood.

Vulnerability isn't emotional dumping on your team. It's not treating your reports like therapists or sharing personal problems that aren't relevant to the work. It's not being weak or indecisive or using "I'm just being vulnerable" as an excuse for poor judgment.

Vulnerability in leadership is the willingness to be honest about uncertainty, mistakes, and limitations. It's saying "I don't know" when you don't know. It's admitting "I was wrong" when you were wrong. It's acknowledging "I need help" when you need help.

It's the opposite of pretending. And in tech, where complexity is the norm and no one person can understand every layer of modern systems, pretending is exhausting and ultimately impossible.

The irony is that this kind of honesty requires tremendous strength. It's much easier to bluff, to hide behind jargon, to deflect questions, to blame others when things go wrong. Vulnerability is hard. But it's the foundation of something essential: trust.

## How vulnerability builds the trust that teams need

Trust is what makes teams functional rather than dysfunctional. Not trust that everyone will do their job, though that's important. I mean the deeper kind: trust that you can speak up without being punished. Trust that admitting a mistake won't get you fired. Trust that asking for help won't mark you as incompetent.

Psychological safety, to use the research term. Google's Project Aristotle found it was the most important factor in high-performing teams. Not talent, not resources, not even team composition. Safety. The belief that you can take interpersonal risks without negative consequences.

And here's the thing about psychological safety: you can't mandate it. You can't send an email saying "everyone should feel safe now." You build it through behavior. Through modeling. Through leaders going first.

When I admitted that architectural mistake in that standup, I did something more important than correcting a technical decision. I established that admitting mistakes was acceptable. Safe, even. Within weeks, team members were catching problems earlier, flagging concerns faster, asking for help when they were stuck rather than struggling silently.

The team got stronger not despite my vulnerability but because of it.

I've seen this pattern repeat across different teams and contexts. The engineering manager who shares in retrospectives that they didn't handle a conflict well and here's what they're trying differently. The tech lead who asks the junior developer to explain something because they genuinely don't understand that part of the codebase. The director who tells their reports they're struggling with a decision and wants to think through it together.

Each of these moments does two things. First, it solves the immediate problem, usually better than pretending would have. But second and more importantly, it gives everyone else permission to be equally honest.

When leaders are vulnerable, teams become honest. And honest teams are effective teams.

## Creating space for collaboration instead of compliance

There's a subtle but important difference between a team that executes and a team that collaborates.

A team that executes follows instructions well. They're competent, professional, and they deliver what you ask for. This is fine for straightforward work with clear requirements. But most interesting tech problems aren't straightforward.

A team that collaborates solves problems together. They challenge assumptions, build on each other's ideas, catch errors before they become expensive, and create solutions better than any individual could have designed alone.

You can't command collaboration. It emerges when people feel safe to contribute fully, to disagree respectfully, to admit confusion, to try things that might not work.

Vulnerability creates that space.

I worked with a team once where planning meetings were performances. Everyone presented their estimates with confidence. No one wanted to be the person who didn't have it figured out. Estimates were consistently optimistic because nobody wanted to seem slow. The backlog was full of work that was "almost done" because admitting you were stuck felt risky.

Then a new tech lead joined who ran meetings differently. When estimating a feature, they'd say things like "I'm honestly not sure about this part. How long do you think it would take to prototype it so we know more?" or "This seems straightforward but I've been wrong about that before. What am I missing?"

It took a few weeks, but the dynamic shifted. People started admitting uncertainty. Estimates got more realistic. Conversations became actual discussions rather than status updates. The pace of delivery didn't slow down; it sped up because we stopped discovering problems three weeks into implementation.

That lead wasn't weak. They were strategic. By modeling uncertainty, they unlocked the collective intelligence of the team.

## Practical ways to practice vulnerability

This sounds good in theory, you might be thinking, but how does it actually work? What does vulnerability look like in practice?

**In planning meetings:** Instead of presenting decisions as final, share your reasoning and invite critique. "Here's my current thinking on this. What am I not considering?" Notice the difference from "Here's the plan." One invites collaboration, one requests compliance.

**In one-on-ones:** Ask for honest feedback and mean it. "What's one thing I could do differently as your manager?" Then, crucially, receive whatever they say without defensiveness. Thank them. And if multiple people mention the same thing, acknowledge it publicly and say what you're trying to change.

**In retrospectives:** Share something you personally could have done better. Go first. Be specific. "I should have caught that resource bottleneck earlier. Next time I'm going to check in on capacity weekly instead of assuming everything is fine." This makes it safe for others to reflect honestly too.

**When you don't know:** Say "I don't know" instead of bluffing. Then add what you do know: "I don't know the right answer here, but I know who we can ask" or "I don't know yet, let me think about it and get back to you tomorrow."

**When you're wrong:** Admit it simply and clearly. "I was wrong about this." Not "mistakes were made" or "in retrospect perhaps" but direct ownership. Then focus on what you're learning and what you'll do differently.

**When facing hard decisions:** Let your team see the tradeoffs. "This decision is difficult because both options have real downsides. Here's what I'm weighing." You don't have to decide by committee, but showing your thinking builds trust and often surfaces factors you hadn't considered.

The common thread in all of these is honesty. Not performative humility, not strategic displays of weakness. Just actual honesty about the reality of leading technical work, which is complex and uncertain and no one has all the answers.

## The moments vulnerability transforms into strength

Let me tell you about a project that was failing. Not the dramatic kind of failure where everything is on fire. The insidious kind where it's behind schedule, morale is low, people are working long hours and producing mediocre work, and everyone knows something is wrong but no one is saying it.

I was brought in to help. First meeting with the team, I asked a simple question: "What's really happening here?"

Silence. Then carefully worded descriptions of technical challenges, resource constraints, changing requirements. All true, but not the real answer.

So I tried something different. "Here's what I'm seeing from the outside. The timeline is unrealistic, the scope is unclear, and I think people are burning out. But I don't understand the details yet. Help me understand what's actually going on."

The senior engineer who'd been quiet spoke up. "The architecture is wrong. We realized it a month ago but we were already behind schedule. We kept hoping we could make it work."

The product manager added, "And I kept changing requirements because stakeholders keep changing what they want, but I didn't want to admit we don't actually have clear product direction."

The team lead: "I knew both those things but I didn't want to be the person who escalates that we need to stop and rethink everything."

Once one person was honest, everyone else felt permission to be honest too. We spent the next two hours in the most productive conversation that project had had in months. By the end we had a plan: pause for one week, fix the architecture, align on real requirements, reset the timeline based on reality.

The project still wasn't easy. But it succeeded, where it had been heading toward expensive failure. Not because I had some brilliant insight, but because vulnerability, mine and then everyone else's, created space for truth.

This happens again and again. A deployment that's going badly but no one wants to admit it until someone says "I think we should roll back." A hiring process that's dragging because nobody wants to say the candidate isn't right. A process that everyone finds annoying but assumes everyone else finds useful, until someone admits "does anyone actually get value from this?"

Vulnerability unlocks truth. And truth, even when uncomfortable, is what teams need to make good decisions.

## Turning failure into growth

The relationship between vulnerability and failure is interesting. Not vulnerability as the cause of failure, but vulnerability as what allows teams to learn from failure.

I've worked in organizations with two very different approaches to failure.

In the first type, failure is quietly buried. Projects that don't work out are canceled with vague explanations. Mistakes are not discussed. People who make errors become cautious, and innovation slows because the perceived cost of being wrong is too high.

In the second type, failure is examined openly. Not to assign blame but to understand. What happened? Why? What would we do differently? What did we learn?

The difference isn't that the second type fails less. Often they fail more, because they take more risks. The difference is that they learn from it.

This requires vulnerability from leadership. It requires being willing to examine your own mistakes publicly. To say in an all-hands meeting "here's a decision I made that didn't work out and here's what I learned." To run blameless postmortems where even the most senior people talk about what they wish they'd done differently.

I've seen this work beautifully. A company I worked with had a regular "lessons learned" session where teams presented projects that failed or had significant problems. Not as a walk of shame, but as learning opportunities. The implicit message was that the only bad failure is the one you don't learn from.

The result was an organization that iterated faster, caught problems earlier, and where people felt safe to experiment. Because vulnerability about failure had made failure less scary.

## The resistance you'll encounter

I should acknowledge that this approach isn't universally welcomed. Some people will interpret vulnerability as weakness. Some organizational cultures actively punish it. Some of your own team members might have been trained, through experience, that admitting uncertainty is dangerous.

You might get pushback. "If you don't know, why are you the leader?" "We need someone decisive, not someone who second-guesses themselves." "Your job is to have answers."

There's a balance to strike. Vulnerability doesn't mean indecisiveness. You still need to make decisions, often with incomplete information. You still need to provide direction. You still need to take responsibility.

But you can do all of those things while being honest about uncertainty. "I'm deciding to go with option A, even though I'm not 100% certain it's right, because we need to move forward and I think it's our best bet given what we know now."

That's both decisive and vulnerable. It's clear direction while being honest about limitations.

If you're in an organization where any admission of uncertainty is seen as weakness, this will be harder. You might need to be strategic about it. Start small. Build trust gradually. Look for allies who understand that psychological safety drives performance.

But I'll be honest: if you're in an environment where vulnerability is punished across the board, you might be in a place that's hostile to the kind of leadership that builds great teams. That's valuable information too.

## What vulnerability has taught me about leadership

I've been reflecting lately on what the most effective leaders I've worked with had in common. They weren't the most technically brilliant, though they were competent. They weren't the most charismatic, though they communicated well. They weren't the most strategic, though they thought clearly.

What they shared was that they made it safe for other people to be fully human at work. To have bad days, to make mistakes, to admit confusion, to ask for help, to disagree, to learn.

They did this by being human themselves. By showing up as whole people rather than polished professional personas. By being vulnerable.

This isn't soft leadership. If anything, it's harder than the alternative. It requires confidence to admit uncertainty. It requires strength to acknowledge mistakes. It requires courage to be honest when it would be easier to pretend.

But it builds something rare and valuable: teams that think together, that solve problems together, that fail fast and learn faster, that innovate because they're not afraid to try things that might not work.

I think back to that moment in standup, admitting my architectural mistake. How scary it felt. How much easier it would have been to find some way to save face.

But what came after was worth it. The team member who admitted they'd had concerns. The honest conversation about what we should do next. The rebuild that went faster because everyone contributed their best thinking rather than waiting for me to have all the answers.

That team ended up being one of the highest-performing I've ever worked with. Not because of my technical skills or vision or management expertise. But because we'd established early that we were in it together, that we could be honest with each other, that admitting you didn't have all the answers was the beginning of finding them together.

## An invitation

If you're leading a tech team, here's what I want to invite you to try.

This week, in one meeting, admit something you don't know. Not as a test or a performance, but genuinely. "I don't actually understand this part. Can someone explain it to me?" or "I'm not sure what the right call is here. Help me think through it."

Notice what happens. Maybe nothing immediately. People might be surprised. But watch over time whether it shifts how your team interacts with you and with each other.

Or try this: in your next one-on-one, ask "What's one thing I could do differently that would make your work easier?" and really listen to the answer. Don't defend, don't explain why you do it that way. Just listen, thank them, and think about it.

These are small acts of vulnerability. But small acts accumulate into culture.

The strongest teams I've built weren't built on certainty. They were built on trust. And trust starts with the willingness to be honest about the limits of what any of us knows, the mistakes all of us make, and the fact that we're better together than alone.

That's vulnerability. And it's not weakness.

It's the foundation of every great team I've ever been part of.
